# imageProcessorC

My first C program. The image processor reads from an input file a set of numbers, the numbers are interpreted as symbols and stored in an array. this array gets processed with different transformations and the results are printed to the command line, and stored in an output file.

Transformations include:
  1. Vertical Mirroring
  2. Horizontal Mirroring
  3. Diagonal Right Mirroring
  4. Diagonal Left Mirroring
  5. 90-degree Rotation Right
